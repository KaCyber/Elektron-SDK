# ETA Java Open Sourcing Effort

Elektron Transport API Java Edition is currently undergoing work to fully open source all of its source code.
This is a work in progress, but we wanted to share it on our GitHub preview branch.  

## Contents: 
The ETA Preview branch contains code from the master branch and has also added
- 'Source/interface' which contains java files associated with the ETA interfaces
- 'Source/impl' which contains the java implementation files for non-JNI based functionality of ETA

The additional code provided is for preview purposes only and it is highly likely to continue to change and be restructured as we progress with the open sourcing effort.  


## Notes:

- Please make sure to review the LICENSE.md file.


Check back over the coming months to see where we are at!
