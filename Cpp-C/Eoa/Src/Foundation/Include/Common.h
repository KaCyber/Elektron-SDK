    \page Using EOA in Multi-Threaded Applications

	By providing thread safe and thread aware implementation, EOA enables application
	developers to take full advantage of multi-core processors and their scalability.
	On the same token, EOA enables developers to design multi-threaded applications that
	best meet their business needs. While designing a multi-threaded EOA application one
	must consider concurrent accessibility of EOA methods from different threads of control.
	The following information is used to identify this capability of each EOA method.

    Depending on whether or not a concurrent access to EOA method is allowed and how,
	EOA methods may be grouped into three categories:

    \section ObjectLevelSafe Object Level Thread Safe
	Multiple application threads of control may concurrently call this method on the same
	instance. Applications will, however, incur the cost of synchronization overhead
	(e.g., blocking) while calling this method. By synchronizing concurrent access
	to this method on per instance basis, EOA preserves the state of individual instances
	and resolves any race condition that may arise while multiple application threads of
	control concurrently call this method on the same instance.

    \section ClassLevelSafe Class Level Thread Safe
	Multiple application threads of control may concurrently call this method across all
	instances. Applications will, however, incur the cost of synchronization overhead
	(e.g., blocking) while calling this method. By synchronizing concurrent access to this
	method on per class basis, EOA preserves the state of all instances and resolves any
	race condition that may arise while multiple application threads of control concurrently
	call this method.

    \section SingleThreaded Lock-free
	Single application thread of control may call such methods on an instance incurring no 
	cost of synchronization overhead. EOA does not synchronize access to this method.
	Concurrent access to the same instance using this method may result in an undefined behaviour.

    EOA method that is considered a thread safe method is explicitly and
	respectively marked as such in this Reference Manual. If there is no thread safety
	marking on a method, this method is considered a \ref SingleThreaded.

    Please see EOA Developer Guide for more details.
